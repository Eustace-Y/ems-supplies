Management of EMS supplies for medication onboard vehicles and stored at home base.

Background: The Supply and Medication Tracking System is designed to assist users in managing their inventory of medical supplies and medications by automating the tracking of expiration dates and stock levels within an EMS system. This system will streamline the process of monitoring both the supplies in the truck and those stored in the supply closet, sending timely alerts when items are about to expire or are running low. Additionally, the program will track supply usage trends and predict future needs, especially considering seasonal fluctuations. The goal is to reduce the risk of shortages or expired supplies, ensuring efficient supply management and optimal patient care.

Currently, users rely on manual inventory checks, which can be time-consuming and error prone. This system will provide a more efficient and proactive solution, enhancing user productivity and patient safety. 

Problem Statement: People often miss tracking the expiration dates of their supplies or underestimate when certain supplies need replenishing. This can result in expired medications being used or supply shortages during critical times. By automating these processes and sending timely notifications, users can efficiently manage their inventory, minimizing risks and improving patient care.

Objective: To provide users with a configurable, secure, and user-friendly tool that tracks medical supplies and medications, monitors expiration dates, predicts supply needs based on historical data, and sends timely alerts when stock is low, or items are about to expire.
